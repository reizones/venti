        <p><strong>Genshin Impact Hu Tao Vs Xiao</strong>. Xiao an immense damage dealer in Genshin Impact. However Xiaos damage ceiling is hard to get close to because you basically need to be lucky with his RNG targeting enemy movements etc. Plus frame-perfect plunge height control etc on top of that. The past few updates in Genshin Impact have been quite a riot.</p>

<p>Anemo is superb as a support element but feels kind of weird to use as main DPS due to the way Swirl and Viridescent 4p works. The news of hutao herself despite not being formally introduced b4 has been spread far and beyond by leakers-. Hu Tao vs Ganyu Primo Geovishap 833. Its mainly because you have to put him on the field to get the most benefit out of him. Zhongli and xiao and frankly the other 5 charas did have better promotion by appearing in the main storyline building up a solid fanbase long before their release. Like Xiaos game play and general design but his personality is kinda meh while thus far loving every thing Ive seen and read about Hu Tao but her garbage attack if the leaks are true leave a bit to be desired.</p>
