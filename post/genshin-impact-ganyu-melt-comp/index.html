        <p><strong>Genshin Impact Ganyu Melt Comp</strong>. Though pair her with a Venti to gather all the mobs in one area and a Bennett to give her the melt damage and that will lead you you hitting well above a 70k crit. Unlike Overloaded Electro-Charged Superconduct and Swirl the order of application is important Pyro state on a target with Cryo or Cryo state on a target with Pyro implying different damage multipliers. Klee will be built for meltcrit rate Klees passive generates energy for the team every time her charge attack crits and with the icebuild her crit chance will be 100 for me. In Genshin Impact with the release of the brand new cryo artifact have come a new team comp as well this time featuring Kaeya as the main DPS carry using the cryo artifact Ganyu will come out in a few days and both will create a Broken TEAM COMPOSITION.</p>

<p>I love using Ganyu but Im honestly getting really sick of rearranging my team once a week trying to optimize her setup. Unlike Overloaded Electro-Charged Superconduct and Swirl the order of application is important Pyro state on a target with Cryo or Cryo state on a target with Pyro implying different damage multipliers. Wanderers Melt Comp. You stack Crit DMG. Has a great AoE CC that groups enemies provides decent amount of energy. So mainly a melt comp with the ideal having ganyus ult up as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="her-damage-is-insane-by-base-so-she-can-solo-clear-most-content">Her damage is insane by base so she can solo clear most content.</h3>
<p>HOWEVER Id say that melt comp is significantly harder to play as there really is not a great pyro applier for Ganyu in the game. So mainly a melt comp with the ideal having ganyus ult up as much as possible. Xingqiu is basically there to be a battery and his ult should let ganyu freeze with her autos after popping her ult. You will need more crit on gear but it has a higher theoretical damage ceiling. Last slot is up to you. As long as you play Ganyu at ranged she is one of few champions that actually doesnt need a team around her.</p>

<p>Xingqiu is basically there to be a battery and his ult should let ganyu freeze with her autos after popping her ult. For Ganyu both main or sub-DPS the reactions that you should invest in are melt which is an amplifying reaction that multiplies the damage that you deal with or freezes which although doesnt give you extra damage provides invaluable crowd control for. So mainly a melt comp with the ideal having ganyus ult up as much as possible. Both have upsidedownside but both are interesting anyway. Ganyu is such a good DPS and there are many ways to play her.</p>
